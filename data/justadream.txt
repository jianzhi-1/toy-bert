Uh, uh, uh (hey)
I was thinking 'bout her (uh), thinking 'bout me (hey)
Thinking 'bout us (us), what we gon' be (hey)
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream (hey)
So I travelled back (uh) down that road
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right
I was thinking 'bout her (uh), thinking 'bout me (hey)
Thinking 'bout us (us), what we gon' be (hey)
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream (hey)
So I travelled back (uh) down that road
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher on but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong
I was thinking 'bout her (uh), thinking 'bout me (hey)
Thinking 'bout us (us), what we gon' be (hey)
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream (hey)
So I travelled back (uh) down that road
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream (uh, uh, hey)
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up (put your hands up)
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing
You could give them everything (everything, hey)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up (put your hands up)
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing
You could give them everything (uh, uh, uh)
I was thinking 'bout her (uh), thinking 'bout me (hey)
Thinking 'bout us (us), what we gon' be (hey)
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream (hey)
So I travelled back (uh) down that road
