Ooh, tada-tada-ta, hey
I guess it's true
I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love
'Cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
No, I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oh, why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look
Gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me
So it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
Darling, stay with me
Won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
Darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see now, baby
Darling, stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love
It's clear to see
Darling, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
Baby
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
This ain't love
And it's clear to see
Darling, stay
