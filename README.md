# Toy BERT
This is a toy version of BERT, created for UC Berkeley CS182 (Fall 2022) Final Project.

We want to achieve three goals:
- construction of the BERT model and training process
- visualize hidden states
- train a classification task using the <NSP> token

### Set-up

### Data
The data are lyrics from various songs. See under the 'data' folder.
